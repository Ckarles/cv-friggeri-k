## about Friggeri CV
Friggeri CV is an elegant *Curriculum Vitae* template for LaTex/XeTex originally written and released by [Adrian Friggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri).

In this work the original template is updated/upgraded and fitted to my personal needs.

## what's new
  - the default font (Helvetica) is replaced by the open source font Roboto from Google, available free of charge [here](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)
  - A4 paper size is now available for the CV class. This option can
be set in the document class declaration as usual, e.g.:

 `\documentclass[a4paper]{friggeri-cv}`

# notes

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use custom fonts, biblatex to print publications and textpos for the aside.
