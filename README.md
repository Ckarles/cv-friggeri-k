## about Friggeri CV
Friggeri CV is an elegant *Curriculum Vitae* template for LaTex/XeTex originally written and released by [Adrian Friggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri).

In this work the original template is updated/upgraded and fitted to my personal needs.

## what's new
    - the default font (Helvetica) is replaced by the free and open source  Roboto font from Google.

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use custom fonts, biblatex to print publications and textpos for the aside.
